This is a remake of the popular game 2048.

Generally there is 4x4 grid with 2048 as the target but here you can choose the NxN grid that you want and can also set the winning number by yourself.

[Instructions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)#:~:text=The%20objective%20of%20the%20game,creating%20tiles%20with%20larger%20numbers.>)

To play the game, you can use the WASD keys which are the classic keys used instead of arrows in videogames.

- W - Move Up
- S - Move Down
- A - Move Left
- D - Move Right

If you reach the target number, you win, but if you are out of moves, you lose!
